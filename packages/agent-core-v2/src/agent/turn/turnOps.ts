/**
 * `turn` domain (L4) — wire Model (`TurnModel`) and the `turn.launch` Op
 * (`launchTurn`) that advances the agent's monotonically-increasing turn id.
 *
 * Declares the next turn id as a wire Model (initial `0`) plus the single Op
 * whose `apply` is the pure extraction of the former live `restoreLaunch` and its
 * `record.define('turn.launch', { resume })` facet: `nextTurnId` becomes
 * `max(current, turnId + 1)` for an integer payload, returning the same reference
 * when the payload does not advance the counter (so the wire's reference-equality
 * gate stays quiet). The `turn.started` / `turn.ended` / `error` signals are not
 * part of this Op and remain on their existing path. Consumed by the Agent-scope
 * `turnService`.
