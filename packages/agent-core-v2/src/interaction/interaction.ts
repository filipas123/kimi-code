/**
 * `interaction` domain (L6) — blocking human-in-the-loop request kernel.
 *
 * Defines the `Interaction` model and the `ISessionInteractionService` kernel that
 * owns the session's pending interaction set: a unified, blocking request /
 * response primitive (`request` → `respond`) with change notification
 * (`onDidChange`), a non-blocking enqueue (`enqueue`) for callers that observe
 * the outcome through the `onDidResolve` stream, and a `listPending` view.
 * `approval`, `question`, and user-tool execution are typed specializations
 * layered on top of this kernel; the kernel itself is domain-agnostic.
 * Session-scoped — the pending set is keyed by session and dies with it.
